## Objectives

<div style="text-align: justify">
Event-based cameras are bio-inspired, asynchronous sensors that offer key advantages of microsecond temporal resolution, low latency, high dynamic range and low power consumption. Because of these advantages, event-based cameras open frontiers that are unthinkable with traditional (frame-based) cameras, which have been the main sensing technology for the past 60 years. These revolutionary sensors enable the design of a new class of efficient algorithms to track a baseball in the moonlight, build a flying robot with the agility of a bee, and perform
structure from motion in challenging lighting conditions and at remarkable speeds. In the last decade, research about these sensors has attracted the attention of industry and academia, fostering exciting advances in the field. The proposed workshop covers the sensing hardware, as well as the processing, data, and learning methods needed to take advantage of the above-mentioned novel cameras. The workshop also considers novel vision sensors, such as
pixel processor arrays, which perform massively parallel processing near the image plane. Because early vision computations are carried out on-sensor (mimicking the retina), the resulting systems have high speed and low-power consumption, enabling new embedded vision applications in areas such as robotics, AR/VR, automotive, gaming, surveillance, etc.
</div>

## Topics Covered

- Event-based / neuromorphic vision.
- Algorithms: motion estimation, visual(-inertial) odometry, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, image
intensity reconstruction, optical flow estimation, recognition, segmentation, feature/object
detection, visual tracking, calibration, action understanding, sensor fusion (video synthesis,
events and RGB, events and LiDAR, etc.), model-based, embedded, or learning-based
approaches.
- Event-based representation, signal processing, and control.
- Event-based active vision, event-based sensorimotor integration.
- Event camera datasets and/or simulators.
- Applications in: computational photography, robotics (navigation, manipulation, drones, obstacle avoidance, human-robot interaction,...), automotive, IoT, AR/VR (e.g., smart eyewear), space science, automated inspection, surveillance, crowd counting, physics, biology.
- Novel hardware (cameras, neuromorphic processors, etc.) and/or software platforms, such as
fully event-based systems (end-to-end).
- New trends and challenges in event-based and/or biologically-inspired vision (SNNs, Reservoir
Computing, etc.).
- Efficient computing architectures for Event-based processing (e.g., HD Computing, State
Space Models).
- Near-focal plane processing, such as pixel processor arrays (PPAs).

## Competitions / Challenges

### 1. Eye-tracking

<p><div style="text-align: justify">
Overview: This challenge focuses on advancing event-based eye tracking, a key technology for driving innovations in interaction technology, extended reality (XR) and cognitive studies. 
While current state-of-the-art devices like Apple's Vision Pro or Meta’s Aria glasses utilize frame-based eye tracking with frame rates from 10 to 100 Hz and latency around 11 ms, there is a pressing need for smoother, faster, and more efficient methods to enhance user experience. By leveraging the event-based eye tracking dataset (<a href="https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2024W/AI4Streaming/papers/Wang_Event-Based_Eye_Tracking._AIS_2024_Challenge_Survey_CVPRW_2024_paper.pdf">3ET+ dataset</a>), this challenge offers participants the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge solutions that push beyond current limitations. Top-1-ranking team will get a Meta Quest 3 as the prize (Sponsored by DVsense).
