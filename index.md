## Objectives

<div style="text-align: justify">
Event-based cameras are bio-inspired, asynchronous sensors that offer key advantages of microsecond temporal resolution, low latency, high dynamic range and low power consumption. Because of these advantages, event-based cameras open frontiers that are unthinkable with traditional (frame-based) cameras, which have been the main sensing technology for the past 60 years. These revolutionary sensors enable the design of a new class of efficient algorithms to track a baseball in the moonlight, build a flying robot with the agility of a bee, and perform
structure from motion in challenging lighting conditions and at remarkable speeds. In the last decade, research about these sensors has attracted the attention of industry and academia, fostering exciting advances in the field. The proposed workshop covers the sensing hardware, as well as the processing, data, and learning methods needed to take advantage of the above-mentioned novel cameras. The workshop also considers novel vision sensors, such as
pixel processor arrays, which perform massively parallel processing near the image plane. Because early vision computations are carried out on-sensor (mimicking the retina), the resulting systems have high speed and low-power consumption, enabling new embedded vision applications in areas such as robotics, AR/VR, automotive, gaming, surveillance, etc.

## Topics Covered

- Event-based / neuromorphic vision.
- Algorithms: motion estimation, visual(-inertial) odometry, SLAM, 3D reconstruction, image
intensity reconstruction, optical flow estimation, recognition, segmentation, feature/object
detection, visual tracking, calibration, action understanding, sensor fusion (video synthesis,
events and RGB, events and LiDAR, etc.), model-based, embedded, or learning-based
approaches.
- Event-based representation, signal processing, and control.
- Event-based active vision, event-based sensorimotor integration.
- Event camera datasets and/or simulators.
- Applications in: computational photography, robotics (navigation, manipulation, drones,
1obstacle avoidance, human-robot interaction,...), automotive, IoT, AR/VR (e.g., smart eyewear),
space science, automated inspection, surveillance, crowd counting, physics, biology.
- Novel hardware (cameras, neuromorphic processors, etc.) and/or software platforms, such as
fully event-based systems (end-to-end).
- New trends and challenges in event-based and/or biologically-inspired vision (SNNs, Reservoir
Computing, etc.).
- Efficient computing architectures for Event-based processing (e.g., HD Computing, State
Space Models).

  For the accepted papers we encourage authors to write a paragraph about ethical considerations and impact of their work.
</div></p>

### Courtesy presentations (in the poster session)
<div style="text-align: justify">
  We also invite courtesy presentations of papers relevant to the workshop that are accepted at CVPR main conference or at other peer-reviewed conferences or journals.
  These presentations provide visibility to your work and help building a community around the topics of the workshop. These contributions will be checked for relevance to the workshop, but will not undergo a complete review, and will not be published in the workshop proceedings.
  Please contact the organizers to make arrangements to showcase your work at the workshop.
